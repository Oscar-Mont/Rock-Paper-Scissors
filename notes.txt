Objective: a console based program that plays a rosk paper scissors game

PROGRAM STRUCTURE:

A function that generates a random choice from the machine.

A function that aks the user for input.
>>>Will require a variable to assign the user input and return its value

A function that executes a round of the game, executing the previous functions and assigning their return values to variables.
>>>Will require two variables to assign each choice to using the other functions.

Odin Project asks to execute the program 5 times so the playRound function will be caleld 5 times for now. Next lesson is on loops and this project will be revisited.
